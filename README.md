# Fitness Equipment and Accessories

## Overview

We're developing a comprehensive e-commerce website for fitness equipment using React, Redux, Mongoose, and Express. This platform aims to offer a seamless shopping experience with features like product listings, detailed product pages, and a user-friendly cart system. Additional features include robust product management capabilities for administrators, debounced search, page refresh warnings to enhance performance and user experience, and optional integration with Stripe for secure payment processing. The goal is to create a modern, efficient, and user-centric online store for fitness enthusiasts.
